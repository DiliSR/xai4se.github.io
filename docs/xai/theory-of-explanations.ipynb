    "## A Theory of Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "According to philosophy, social science, and psychology theories, a\n",
    "common definition of *explainability or interpretability* is *the degree\n",
    "to which a human can understand the reasons behind a decision or an\n",
    "action* {cite}`Miller19`. The explainability of AI/ML algorithms can be\n",
    "achieved by (1) making the entire decision-making process transparent\n",
    "and comprehensible and (2) explicitly providing an explanation for each\n",
    "decision {cite}`lipton2018mythos` (since an explanation is not likely applicable to\n",
    "all decisions {cite}`leake2014evaluating`. Hence, research has emerged to\n",
    "explore how to explain decisions made by complex, black-box models and\n",
    "how explanations are presented in a form that would be easily understood\n",
    "(and hence, accepted) by humans.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Explainability Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Please check this subsection._**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of AI/ML systems can be presented in various forms to serve various goals of different stakeholders.\n",
    "For example, the goal of software managers is to understand the general characteristics of software projects that are associated with defect-proneness to chart appropriate qualitity improvement plans.\n",
    "Thus, explanations needed by such software managers are generic explanations that describe the whole reasons and logic behind decisions of AI/ML systems.\n",
    "On the other hand, the goal of software developers is to understand why a particular file is predicted as defective by AI/ML systems to mitigate the risk of such file being defective.\n",
    "In this case, explanations needed by software developers are explanations that are specific to such file and describe the reasons and logic behind defective predictions made by AI/ML systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "TODO?\n",
    "Different stakeholders have different goals, thus require different forms of explanations. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Explanations?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a philosophical and psychological theory of explanations,\n",
    "Salmon  {cite}`Salmon84` argue that explanations can be presented as a causal\n",
    "chain of causes that lead to the decision. Causal chains can be\n",
    "classified into five categories {cite}`Hilton2005`: temporal, coincidental,\n",
    "unfolding, opportunity chains and pre-emptive. Each type of causal chain\n",
    "is thus associated with an explanation type. However, identifying the\n",
    "complete causal chain of causes is challenging, since most AI/ML\n",
    "techniques produce only correlations instead of causations.\n",
    "In contrast, Miller {cite}`Miller19` argue that explanations can be presented\n",
    "as answers to why-questions. Similarly, Lipton {cite}`lipton1990contrastive` also share\n",
    "a similar view of explanations as being contrastive. \n",

    "**_Please check this subsection._**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lim and Dey categorized questions towards the inference mechanism of AI/ML systems into: What, Why, Why Not, What If, and How To.\n",
    "While they initially found that Why and Why Not explanations were most effective in promoting system understanding and trust [65],\n",
    "they later found that users use different strategies to check model behavior and thus use different intelligibility queries for the same interpretability goals [68, 70]. \n",
    "Below, we provide an example of questions for each type of the intelligibility questions.\n",
    "- *What*: What is the logic behind the AI/ML models?\n",
    "- *Why*: Why is an instance predicted as TRUE?\n",
    "- *Why Not*: Why is an instance predicted as TRUE?\n",
    "- *What If*: What would the system predict if the values of an instance are changed?\n",
    "- *How To*: How can we reverse the prediction of an instance (e.g., from TRUE to FALSE) generated by the system?\n",

    "    techniques (e.g., decision tree, decision rules or logistic\n",

    "    ANOVA, variable importance) so the entire predictions and\n",
    "    recommendations process are transparent and comprehensible. Such\n",
    "    intrinsic model-specific techniques aim to provide the global\n",
    "    explainability. Thus, users can only understand how the model works\n",
    "    globally (e.g., by inspecting a branch of decision trees). However,\n",
    "    users often do not understand why the model makes that prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Local Explanability:** Using model-agnostic techniques (e.g.,\n",
    "    LIME {cite}`ribeiro2016should`) to explain the predictions of the\n",
    "    software analytics models (e.g., neural network, random forest).\n",
    "    Such post-hoc model-agnostic techniques can provide an explanation\n",
    "    for each prediction (i.e., an instance to be explained). Users can\n",
