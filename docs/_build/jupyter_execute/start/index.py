# # Software Analytics in a Nutshell
# 
# The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making (see {numref}`Figure {number} <complex-decision-making>`). For example, which tasks should a developer do first,
# who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However,
# erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation.

# Today's software development processes depend on a variety of development tools, such as issue tracking systems, version control
# systems, code review, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and Q&A websites. Such tools generate large quantities of unstructured
# software artefacts at a high frequency (so-called Big Data) in many forms like issue reports, source code, test cases, code reviews,
# execution logs, app reviews, developer mailing lists, and discussion threads.

# **Software Analytics** is a software engineering discipline that focuses
# on leveraging AI/ML and data **analytics** techniques to uncover interesting and actionable knowledge from the unprecedented amount of **software data**Â {cite}`menzies2013software` {cite}`tantithamthavorn2018pitfalls`.
# Many software organisations (e.g., Microsoft, Facebook, and Google) currently use powerful AI/ML techniques to make data-driven engineering
# decisions and automate software engineering tasks. For example, software defect prediction, effort estimation, task prioritization, task
# recommendation, expert recommendation, code generation, developers' productivity prediction, malware detection, and security vulnerability detection.
