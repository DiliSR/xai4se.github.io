# # Use-case Scenario
# 
# In todayâ€™s increasingly digitalized world, software defects are widespread and enormously expensive, but they are very hard to detect, predict, and prevent. 
# Thus, a failure to eliminate software defects in safety-critical systems could result in serious injury to people, threats to life, death, and disasters. 
# Here, we present 3 use-case scenarios of eXplainable AI defect prediction framework to achieve the followings:
# - Generating fine-grained predictions in order to help developers *localize which lines of code are the most risky* so developers can allocate limited software quality assurance activities in a cost-effective manner{cite}`wattanakriengkrai2020`.
# - Generating explanations for each prediction to help developers *understand why a file is predicted as defective*{cite}`jiarpakdee2020modelagnostic`.
# - Generating actionable guidance to help managers *chart appropriate quality improvement plans*.
