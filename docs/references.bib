	abstract     = {Studies have shown that social factors in development organizations have a dramatic effect on software quality. Separately, program dependency information has also been used successfully to predict which software components are more fault prone. Interestingly, the influence of these two phenomena have only been studied separately. Intuition and practical experience suggests,however, that task assignment (i.e. who worked on which components and how much) and dependency structure (which components have dependencies on others)together interact to influence the quality of the resulting software. We study the influence of combined socio-technical software networks on the fault-proneness of individual software components within a system. The network properties of a software component in this combined network are able to predict if an entity is failure prone with greater accuracy than prior methods which use dependency or contribution information in isolation. We evaluate our approach in different settings by using it on Windows Vista and across six releases of the Eclipse development environment including using models built from one release to predict failure prone components in the next release. We compare this to previous work. In every case, our method performs as well or better and is able to more accurately identify those software components that have more post-release failures, with precision and recall rates as high as 85\%.},

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

	abstract     = {Software analytic builds quality prediction models for software projects. Experience shows that (a) the more projects studied, the more varied are the conclusions; and (b) project managers lose faith in the results of software analytics if those results keep changing To reduce this conclusion instability, we propose "bellwethers": given N projects from a community the bellwether is the project whose data yields best predictions on all others. The bellwethers offer a way to tame conclusion stability because conclusions about a community are stable as long as this bellwether continues as the best oracle. Bellwethers are also simple to discover (just wrap a for-loop around standard data miners). When compared to other transfer learning methods (TCA+, transfer Naive Bayes, value cognitive boosting), using just the bellwether data to construct a simple transfer learner yields comparable predictions. Further, bellwethers appear in many SE tasks such as defect prediction, effort estimation, bad smell detection and predicting issue lifetime. We hence recommend using bellwethers as a baseline method for transfer learning against which future work should be compared.},

Many such models have been proposed, their evaluation, however, is still an open question, as recent publications show. An important aspect often ignored during evaluation is the effort reduction gained by using such models. Models are usually evaluated per module by performance measures used in information retrieval, such as recall, precision, or the area under the ROC curve (AUC). These measures assume that the costs associated with additional quality assurance activities are the same for each module, which is not reasonable in practice. For example, costs for unit testing and code reviews are roughly proportional to the size of a module. In this paper, we investigate this discrepancy using optimal and trivial models. We describe a trivial model that takes only the module size measured in lines of code into account, and compare it to five classification methods. The trivial model performs surprisingly well when evaluated using AUC. However, when an effort-sensitive performance measure is used, it becomes apparent that the trivial model is in fact the worst.

Over time, plenty of data sets became available, especially for defect prediction problems. Aims: In this study, we investigate possible problems and pitfalls that occur during replication. This information can be used for future replication studies, and serve as a guideline for researchers reporting novel results. Method: We replicate two recent defect prediction studies comparing different data sets and learning algorithms, and report missing information and problems. Results: Even with access to the original data sets, replicating previous studies may not lead to the exact same results. The choice of evaluation procedures, performance measures and presentation has a large influence on the reproducibility. Additionally, we show that trivial and random models can be used to identify overly optimistic evaluation measures. Conclusions: The best way to conduct easily reproducible studies is to share all associated artifacts, e.g. scripts and programs used. When this is not an option, our results can be used to simplify the replication task for other researchers.},

It is critical to find the optimum bound, i.e. threshold, which would best separate defective and defect-free classes in software data. We have applied decision threshold optimization on Naiumlve Bayes classifier in order to find the optimum threshold for software defect data. ROC analyses show that decision threshold optimization significantly decreases false alarms (on the average by 11\%) without changing probability of detection rates.},
