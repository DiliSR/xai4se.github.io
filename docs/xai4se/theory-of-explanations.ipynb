    "Causal explanation refers to an explanation that is\n",

    "a foil did not happen. The selected subset of causes thus\n",

    "## A Theory of Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a philosophical and psychological theory of explanations,\n",
    "Salmon  {cite}`Salmon84` argue that explanations can be presented as a causal\n",
    "chain of causes that lead to the decision. Causal chains can be\n",
    "classified into five categories {cite}`Hilton2005`: temporal, coincidental,\n",
    "unfolding, opportunity chains and pre-emptive. Each type of causal chain\n",
    "is thus associated with an explanation type. However, identifying the\n",
    "complete causal chain of causes is challenging, since most AI/ML\n",
    "techniques produce only correlations instead of causations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Miller {cite}`Miller19` argue that explanations can be presented\n",
    "as answers to why-questions. Similarly, Lipton {cite}`lipton1990contrastive` also share\n",
    "a similar view of explanations as being *contrastive*. There are three\n",
    "components of why-questions {cite}`van1980scientific`: (1) the event to be explained,\n",
    "also called the *explanandum* (e.g., file A is defective); (2) a set of\n",
    "similar events that are similar to the explanandum but did not occur\n",
    "(e.g., file A is clean); and (3) a request for information that can\n",
    "distinguish the occurrence of the explanandum from the non-occurrence of\n",
    "the other similar events (e.g., a large number of changes made to file\n",
    "A). Below, we describe four types of why-questions:\n",
