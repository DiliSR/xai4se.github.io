    "# A Theory of Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a philosophical and psychological theory of explanations,\n",
    "Salmon  {cite}`Salmon84` argue that explanations can be presented as a causal\n",
    "chain of causes that lead to the decision. Causal chains can be\n",
    "classified into five categories {cite}`Hilton2005`: temporal, coincidental,\n",
    "unfolding, opportunity chains and pre-emptive. Each type of causal chain\n",
    "is thus associated with an explanation type. However, identifying the\n",
    "complete causal chain of causes is challenging, since most AI/ML\n",
    "techniques produce only correlations instead of causations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Miller {cite}`Miller19` argue that explanations can be presented\n",
    "as answers to why-questions. Similarly, Lipton {cite}`lipton1990contrastive` also share\n",
    "a similar view of explanations as being *contrastive*. There are three\n",
    "components of why-questions {cite}`van1980scientific`: (1) the event to be explained,\n",
    "also called the *explanandum* (e.g., file A is defective); (2) a set of\n",
    "similar events that are similar to the explanandum but did not occur\n",
    "(e.g., file A is clean); and (3) a request for information that can\n",
    "distinguish the occurrence of the explanandum from the non-occurrence of\n",
    "the other similar events (e.g., a large number of changes made to file\n",
    "A). Below, we describe four types of why-questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Plain-fact** is the properties of the object. *Why does object\n",
    "    $a$ have property $P$?*\n",
    "    \\\n",
    "    Example: Why is file $A$ defective?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers to the P-contrast, O-contrast and T-contrast why-questions form\n",
    "an explanation. *Contrastive explanations focus on only the differences\n",
    "on **Properties within an object** (Property-contrast), between **two\n",
    "Objects** (Object-contrast), and **within an object over Time**\n",
    "(Time-contrast) {cite}`VanBouwel2002`.* Answering a plain fact question is\n",
    "generally more difficult than generating answers to the contrastive\n",
    "questions {cite}`lipton1990contrastive`. For example, we could answer the\n",
    "Property-contrast question (e.g., \"Why is file $A$ classified as being\n",
    "defective instead of being clean?\") by citing that there are a\n",
    "substantial number of defect-fixing commits that involve with the file.\n",
    "Information about the size, complexity, owner of the file, and so on are\n",
    "not required to answer this question. On the other hand, explaining why\n",
    "file $A$ is defective in a non-contrastive manner would require us to\n",
    "use all causes. In addition, humans tend to be cognitively attached to\n",
    "digest contrastive explanations {cite}`Miller19`. Thus, contrastive\n",
    "explanations may be more valuable and more intuitive to humans. These\n",
    "important factors from both social and computational perspectives should\n",
    "be considered when providing explainable models or tool support for\n",
    "software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation is not only a *product*, as discussed above, but also a\n",
    "*process* {cite}`Lombrozo2006`. In fact, generating explanations is a\n",
    "*cognitive process* which essentially involves four cognitive systems:\n",
    "(1) attention, (2) long-term memory, (3) working memory, and (4)\n",
    "metacognition {cite}`Horne2019`{cite}`leake2014evaluating`. Recent\n",
    "work {cite}`Miller19` further recognised the importance of considering\n",
    "explanation as being not only a cognitive process but also a *social\n",
    "process*, in which an explainer communicates knowledge to an explainee.\n",
    "Using this view, explanations should be considered as part of a\n",
    "conversation between the explainer and explainee. The theories, models,\n",
    "and processes of how humans explain decisions to one another are\n",
    "important to the work on explainable software analytics and the\n",
    "development of explainable tool support for software engineering in\n",
